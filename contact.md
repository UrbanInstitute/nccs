If you are a new nonprofit looking for an NTEE code please visit the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://nccs.urban.org/nccs/faq/) page for resources. 

If you are an existing nonprofit trying to find your NTEE code you will likely find [ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/) search engine easier to navigate than bulk data downloads, as most of our tools are designed for researchers, analysts, or other data providers.
