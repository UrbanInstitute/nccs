In no event will the Institute or its affiliates or any party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services be liable for any direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of your access, use, misuse, or inability to use the services or any linked sites.

The Institute does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Services by any user, information provider, or any other person or entity.  The opinions posted on the Site are solely those of the author and not of the Urban Institute or its officers, staff, board, funders, or organizations with which it may have a relationship.

#### 9.     Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Institute and its affiliates, and their respective members, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, and licensors, from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation by you of these Terms and Conditions or any breach by you of your representations and warranties hereunder. The Institute reserves the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this Section. In such event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.

If you are outside of the United States and use the Services, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.

#### 12. Severability

If a court finds any provision in these Terms of Use to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.

#### 13. Miscellaneous

13.1 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will serve to preempt the promises made in policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.

13.2 The failure of the Institute to enforce any provisions of the Terms or to respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its rights to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect with similar breaches. 

13.3 The Institute and its affiliates respect the intellectual property of others.
