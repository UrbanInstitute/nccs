abstract: "Nonprofit organizations in the United States play a vital role delivering services, strengthening communities, and facilitating civic engagement. In our nationally representative surveys of nonprofit organizations, we focus on operating 501(c)(3) public charities whose activities range from direct service provision to community building and advocacy. We provide public use datasets of most of the survey data we collect so that others across the country can investigate questions of their own."

Qualtrics survey files (QCF) are available for all versions of the survey instrument and are shared so that researchers may incorporate Nonprofit Trends questions into their own surveys. Public use data files serve as nationally-representative benchmarks that are helpful for triangulating results of any custom study samples. Pro-programmed Qualtrics files make it easier to integrate these existing survey tools into your own study. See "Survey Question" links above for word document versions of the instruments.
