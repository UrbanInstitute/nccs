## Overview 

This page consolidates the datasets and code used in Urban's interactive <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-financial-risk-nonprofits-losing-government-grants">data tool</a> on the financial risk of nonprofits losing government grants. In alignment with Open Science principles, Urban’s National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) has made all resources used for this tool freely available to ensure reproducibility and knowledge sharing. This approach to transparency and collaboration supports accelerated discovery, democratization of knowledge, and enhanced public trust in scientific research. By opening access to both data and methodologies, other researchers and organizations can verify findings, build upon this work, or adapt it to address similar challenges in different contexts.

## Open Science Assets  

This following section contains four resources used to develop this tool. The first is a reproducible codebase hosted on a public GitHub repository. The second is NCCS’s archive of processed electronically filed Form 990 and Form 990 EZ returns. The third is a series of geographic crosswalks. These are individual .csv files mapping Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes across various Census geographies. And the final dataset is NCCS's unified Business Master File (BMF) that creates a single consolidated BMF containing demographic information on all tax-exempt organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
