## Overview 

To provide a sense of the level of financial risk that nonprofits might face if they lost their government grants, this interactive report calculates the operating surplus of grant recipients with and without grant revenue. The calculation conveys the share of nonprofits that would be exposed to fiscal shortfalls were they to lose their government grants in each region or subsector. A positive operating surplus indicates a nonprofit can cover all of its expenses in a given year, while a negative surplus indicates they would be forced to run deficits, cut programs, fire staff, or in some cases close. The calculation is meant to capture the scope and size of potential impacts from government retrenchment.
