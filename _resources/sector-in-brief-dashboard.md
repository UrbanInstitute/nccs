abstract: "Since 1996, the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) has processed and published comprehensive data on all tax-exempt 501(c) classifications and subsectors, including 501(c)(3) public charities and private foundations and 501(c)(4) organizations, to advance research and deepen understanding of nonprofits. Through its Nonprofit Sector in Brief report series, NCCS shed light on the size and finances of nonprofits.\n

Now, the Nonprofit Sector in Brief Dashboard aggregates more than three decades of NCCS data to illuminate trends in the nonprofit sector. The dashboard currently provides data up to 2021 and will be continuously updated with the most recent available data. View data and trends by organization type, subsector, asset size, geography, and time period to see a snapshot of the nonprofit sector as seen through IRS data. Nonprofit Sector in Brief reports from 2009 to 2019 can be accessed at the bottom of this page."
