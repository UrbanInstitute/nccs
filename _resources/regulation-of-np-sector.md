## Project History 

The Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute and Columbia University’s Charities Regulatory and Oversight Project joined forces in 2015 to create and colead the Regulation of Nonprofits and Philanthropy Project at the Urban Institute with funding by the Mott Foundation. Both entities promoted research and knowledge sharing and had programs that brought together charities officials to discuss issues affecting the nonprofit sector.

 Shortly after its founding by Elizabeth Boris in 1996, the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy (CNP) and its flagship program, the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), began to host twice-yearly meetings with state charities officials and Internal Revenue Service officials, primarily to discuss data and reporting issues on Form 990 affecting the nonprofit sector. These sessions were augmented by Emerging Issues Seminars on a variety of policy issues facing the nonprofit sector that were cohosted by CNP and the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University. 

Inaugurated with the first conference to convene state attorneys general, foundations, and nonprofit leaders, in 2006 Columbia University launched the Charities Regulatory and Oversight Project as part of the National State Attorney’s General Program. The conference and project were at the time supported by the Ford Foundation, C.S. Mott Foundation, New York Community Trust, and the Surdna Foundation. Hosting regular meetings and trainings for state charities officials, the project developed conferences with state and federal regulators, practitioners, and academics in attendance. In 2013, the project hosted a major research conference on the future of state charities regulation; those papers can be found [here](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/search?f%5Bseries_ssim%5D%5B%5D=2013+Charities+Regulation+and+Oversight+Project+Policy+Conference). 

Cindy M. Lott, founder and director of the Columbia University project within the National State Attorneys General Program, initiated a research collaboration with CNP led by Boris to conduct a groundbreaking study of state charity offices, resulting in the report ***State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector***.

**Phase One**

The first phase of the research focused on the jurisdiction of state attorneys’ general over the charitable sector but expanded the scope to encompass the entire regulatory framework of the charitable sector, including all state and federal charities officials and jurisdiction. 

A comprehensive survey was fielded to state charity officials about their activities and identified research gaps, reported in State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector by Cindy M. Lott, Elizabeth T. Boris, and coauthors. With the data from the study serving as the foundation, the project hosted a symposium, “State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector,” that resulted in reports, articles, and a regulatory conference organized in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission.

**Phase Two** 

In the second phase of the project, parts of the legal compendium were updated and research included two briefs, "Bifurcation of State Regulation of Charities: Divided Regulatory Authority Over Charities and Its Impact on Charitable Solicitation Laws," and "State Regulation of the Charitable Sector: Enforcement, Outreach, Structure, and Staffing." Research was presented at major sector, regulatory, and legal education venues, and the work was also disseminated through blog posts.

**Phase Three**

In the third phase, the project held a symposium, “The Future of Regulation in the United States,” with research papers presented by scholars and practitioners that are available online at the journal Nonprofit Policy Forum. Those papers will be published in a special issue of the journal in early 2026. 
Questions about nonprofit regulation were added to Urban’s National Survey of Nonprofit Trends and Impacts to learn about interactions between nonprofits and government and the impact of regulations on nonprofit organizations. Those findings were first reported in a 2025 brief, “[Nonprofits’ Contact with Offices or Agencies That Regulate Charities, 2024](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/nonprofits-contact-offices-and-agencies-regulate-charities-2024).”

In addition, the legal compendium is being expanded by Teresa Harrison (Drexel University) with digital text of the statutes affecting nonprofits. The expanded compendium will be available in early 2026 and will enable more detailed research on regulatory issues. 

## The Database

The legal compendium was created as a downloadable Excel spreadsheet with statutory citations showing the following information for each of the 56 jurisdictions featured in this research: the grant of jurisdiction to attorneys general and other state agencies, the registration and reporting requirements applicable to charitable entities and their fundraisers, the oversight responsibilities of state charity regulators in connection with certain transactions involving charitable entities, the obligations of charities to notify the attorney general of those transactions, and some enforcement remedies available to charity regulators.

In the current phase, the Legal Compendium has been updated with the most current data available and is being enhanced with digital text data that will be available in late 2025.

An interactive version of the compendium can be accessed via the link below. Users can explore the compendium by grouping, filtering, and sorting the records. It comes prepopulated with a record of all nonprofit regulations grouped by state. Instructions are as follows:

-	Group: Click the Group button to organize the data based on the values in a specific column (e.g., grouping all entries by "State").
-	Filter: Click the Filter button to show only the records that meet specific criteria (e.g., filtering to only show entries where "Regulatory Body" is "Attorney General").
-	Descriptions: Hover over the information bubble to read descriptions of each column’s contents.

### Events 

<br>

**2024: The Future of Nonprofit Regulation in the United States**

> This two-day hybrid symposium featured 21 presentations of papers written for the meeting on topics including the first amendment and political activities, civic engagement, improving regulatory structures, global perspectives, and commentaries on the future of regulation. These papers were peer reviewed and edited for inclusion in a special issue of Nonprofit Policy Forum available in early 2026. The agenda for the symposium is available [here](https://urbanorg.box.com/shared/static/xjxsx90u6jfqglu4bh9f9u2wj9q7ez34.docx). Papers are listed under Select Publications below.


**2021: Data and Technology: Resources and Implications for Nonprofit Regulation and Oversight**

> This [event](http://urban.org/sites/default/files/2021/03/25/final_agenda_-_cnp_regulations_jv_reordered3.pdf) focused on data and technologies state and federal charities regulators need to succeed in their oversight roles. Researchers, leaders from data-providing organizations, and state and federal charities regulators explored how to promote data-informed nonprofit regulation.

**2019: What We Know; What We Need to Know and the Future of Nonprofit Regulation**

<br>

**2016: State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector** 

> In this [symposium](https://www.urban.org/events/state-regulation-and-enforcement-charitable-sector), participants discussed [*State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector*](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/state-regulation-and-enforcement-charitable-sector), a report that provided a primer and road map on the state regulatory structures that oversee the charitable and nonprofit sector, toward the goal of more effective and efficient charity regulation. Topics included a summary and discussion of the report findings, the status of state charitable regulatory and enforcement activity, and next steps in formulating a research agenda.

**2015: Data Collection, Sharing, and Transparency in the Tax-Exempt Sector**

> The goals of [this convening](https://www.urban.org/events/regulation-nonprofits-and-philanthropy-project) were to discuss the ripple effects of regulatory changes regarding data collection, sharing, and transparency; discuss opportunities and challenges in the nonprofit sector resulting from these challenges; and explore inefficiencies and redundancies in data transfer that might be eliminated in the future among the sector’s stakeholders.
