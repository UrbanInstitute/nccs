**Phase One**

With funding from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, The Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, led by Elizabeth T. Boris, Center Director, became the home for research on state nonprofit regulatory work that had previously been undertaken through The Charities Regulation and Oversight Project (“Charities Project”), part of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School under the leadership of Cindy M. Lott. This first phase of the research focused on state attorneys’ general jurisdiction over the charitable sector but expanded the scope of the project to encompass the entire regulatory framework of the charitable sector, including all state and federal charities officials and jurisdiction.

**Phase Two** 

In the second phase of the research, a results from a survey of state charity regulators identified existing research, needs, and gaps that serves as the basis for the report, "State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable Sector" by Cindy M. Lott, Elizabeth T. Boris et. al. With the data from the study serving as the foundation, a major meeting was planned that resulted in reports, articles, and a regulatory conference planned in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission.

**Phase Three**

In the third phase of the Project, with ongoing funding from the Mott Foundation, portions of the Legal Compendium were updated and research was published in various fora, including two online briefs - "Bifurcation of State Regulation of Charities: Divided Regulatory Authority Over Charities and Its Impact on Charitable Solicitation Law", and "State Regulation of the Charitable Sector: Enforcement, Outreach and Staffing". Research was presented at major sector, regulatory, and legal education venues. Publications and blogs helped disseminate the work.

The *Legal Compendium*, an online resource of state statutes affecting nonprofits was created by project staff with assistance and input from state regulators. It was made available on the Urban Institute Website in 2016 and updated under the direction of Dr. Mary Shelly, University of Pennsylvania, in 2019 (Version 2). 

**Phase Four**

In April 2024, a symposium on the Future of Nonprofit Regulation in the United States was held at the Urban Institute. Papers presented at the [symposium](https://urbanorg.box.com/s/epcbasvdh00di0fjep2y58380riupzum) will be published in a special edition of the journal, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly.

The Legal Compendium was updated again in 2023-24 (Version 3) to include the most recent (2019) citations of state statutes affecting nonprofits by Dr. Mary Shelly (University of Pennsylvania) and is available on the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) website in a new [database format](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2019/12/06/legal_compendium_oct_2019_update_.xlsx). 

The newest version of the *Legal Compendium*, the *Digitized Legal Compendium*, is enhanced with Legal Text Data of state statutes compiled by Dr. Teresa Harrison of Drexel University. In collaboration with Jesse Lecy, Urban Institute, the resulting database will be searchable and available on the NCCS website in fall of 2025.

## The *Legal Compendium* Database (V2)

The Legal Compendium is a downloadable Excel spreadsheet with statutory citations showing the following information for each of the 56 jurisdictions featured in this research: the grant of jurisdiction to attorneys general and other state agencies, the registration and reporting requirements applicable to charitable entities and their fundraisers, the oversight responsibilities of state charity regulators in connection with certain transactions involving charitable entities, the obligations of charities to notify the attorney general of those transactions, and some enforcement remedies available to charity regulators.
