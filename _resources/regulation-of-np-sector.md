## Background and Support

This project brings together cross-disciplinary groups of scholars and experts to advance a framework for understanding of how regulation effects nonprofit organizations and philanthropy and empirical research on the topic. The work has been conducted in partnership with the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute (the current project home), the Tax Policy and Charities Project, Indiana University, the University of Pennsylvania's College of Law, Columbia University's School of Law, and supported by the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS).

Using a mix of research methodologies and data sources, this project aims to fills gaps in the nonprofit sector regulatory framework. The goal is to develop frameworks that are elastic enough to encompass the constantly evolving nonprofit and philanthropic sectors and provide resources to disseminate best practices.

**Phase Zero** 

The initial project was developed by Cindy M. Lott at Columbia University Law School over the period 2006-2015 with the title of “Charities Regulation and Oversight Project”. 

**Phase One**

With funding from the Mott Foundation, The Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and
Philanthropy became the home for research on state nonprofit regulatory work that had
previously been undertaken through The Charities Regulation and Oversight Project (“Charities
Project”), part of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School under
the leadership of Cindy M. Lott. In this first phase of the research, we focused on state
attorneys’ general jurisdiction over the charitable sector but expanded the scope of the project
to encompass the entire regulatory framework of the charitable sector, including all state and
federal charities officials and jurisdiction.

**Phase Two** 

In the second phase of the research, using State Regulation and Enforcement in the Charitable
Sector by Cindy M. Lott, Elizabeth T. Boris et. al., a report on the ground-breaking survey we
conducted for the project as the basis for discussion, we identified existing research, needs, and
gaps. Using the data from that study and other sources, we held a major meeting, completed
reports and articles, gave presentations, and collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission
on a regulatory conference.

**Phase Three**

In the third phase of the Project, we updated portions of the Legal Compendium and focused
on publishing and presenting research in various fora, including two online briefs, Bifurcation of
State Regulation of Charities: Divided Regulatory Authority Over Charities and Its Impact on
Charitable Solicitation Law, and State Regulation of the Charitable Sector: Enforcement,
Outreach and Staffing, as well as a blog article; some of the project data was used for other
research. We made presentations at major sector, regulatory, and legal education venues.

**Phase Four**

In the current phase of the project, we are: 1) updating the entire Legal Compendium; 2)
developing a symposium for Spring 2024 that will be an overview of major current regulatory
issues in the philanthropic and nonprofit sector and potential future changes; 3) with a
separate, additional grant, we are enhancing the Legal Compendium into a form that will be
integrated into two major sector data platforms. First, the Legal Compendium data will be
combined with Legal Text Data compiled by Professor Teresa Harrison at Drexel University. In
collaboration Jesse Lecy, director of the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), we are
working out the logistics of adding the combined legal dataset to the NCCS webpage.

## The Database



The Legal Compendium is a downloadable Excel spreadsheet with statutory citations showing the following information for each of the 56 jurisdictions featured in this research: the grant of jurisdiction to attorneys general and other state agencies, the registration and reporting requirements applicable to charitable entities and their fundraisers, the oversight responsibilities of state charity regulators in connection with certain transactions involving charitable entities, the obligations of charities to notify the attorney general of those transactions, and some enforcement remedies available to charity regulators.
